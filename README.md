<h1>Movie Recommender System</h1> 

<h3>1. What will this Web app do (Objectives)?</h3>
<h4><ul><li>As the name suggests, it recommends movies based on different kinds of filtering techniques.
<li>Users can get the recommendations of the movies which are popular or the movies which are related to some other movie.
<li>The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch.</ul></h4> 

<h3>2. Why do we need Movie Recommender system?</h3>
<h4><ul><li>Recommender systems help to personalize a platform and help the user find something they like.
<li>The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch.</ul></h4> 

<h3>3. The project consists of following parts:</h3>
<h4><ul><li>Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Building -  Machine Learning  (Jupyter Notebook)
<li>Web App - Streamlit
<li>Deployment - Heroku</ul></h4>

<h3>4. Front-End Information</h3>
<h4>The front-end consists of 4 web pages:
<ul><li>About Page - The first page which is displayed to the user is about page where user finds out a paragraph related to the the movie recommendation system.
<li>Content Based Recommendation System Page - On this page, the user give some input by selecting a movie from the drop-down menu and click on the show recommendation button then a list of recommended movie based on content filtering technique is displayed.
<li>Collaborative Based Recommendation System Page - On this page, the user give input by selecting a movie and a rating on it then a list of recommended movies displayed to the user based on the collaborative filtering technique. 
<li>Popularity Based Recommendation System Page - On this page, the user finds the movies which are popular at that time according to the user id.</ul></h4>

<h3>5. Project Workflow</h3>
<h4><ul><li>This project is basically an implementation of Movie Recommender System using different filtering techniques used in machine learning.
<li>Different pages in the app are using different filtering techniques based on which user get the resultant movie recommendations.
<li>User can get a list of movies as an output when go on popularity based recommender system page where movies diplayed according to user id.
<li>User can get movie recommendations based on content based filtering technique by providing a movie as input or selecting it from the drop-down menu.
<li>User can get movie recommendations based on collaborative based filtering technique by providing a movie as input or selecting it from the drop-down menu and set the rating using range parameter.</ul></h4>
